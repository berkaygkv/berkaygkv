### Hey 
I'm a Data Scientist who has been building ML/DL models, Automation and Data Manipulation tools, Pipelines and more...ðŸ‘‹

__Love Coding__:

  - ML/DL models that not only aims to be high performance but also highly efficient, clean and scalable,
  - Programs that cover all the fundamental stages of end-to-end pipelines namely data collection, preprocessing, model building, output distribution,
  - The widely used tech stack and frameworks to every single project (e.g., Docker, Cloud Services, MLFlow etc.),
  - Out of box solutions that bring novel perspective to the problem at hand,
  - Somebody else's work and making a few tweak to it to see if it can serve to my purpose.
  
__Love Learning__:

  - How state of the art algorithms can be built from scratch,
  - What and how other open source frameworks can be implemented various kinds of problems to make them even more efficient,
  - Better ways to make a piece of code clean, more appealing and reusable,
  - How a piece of information can be presented in the best way possible.
  
__Love Telling__:

  - How I came up with what I did,
  - What other possible ways I have proposed when solving the problem at hand,
  - What kind of picture the models/results are depicting.
